# Jupyter notebooks for python and data analysis with pandas

### Quickstart guide to jupyter notebooks

A notebook is a list of code cells, where we write and evaluate python code, and markdown cells, where we describe what the code does. To create a new code cell, click on the **+** icon at the top left. You may change its type to markdown via the dropdown menu on the right. To edit a cell, double click on it. To evaluate a cell, select it and press `Ctrl+Enter`, to evaluate and select the next cell press `Shift+Enter`.
Pressing `Tab` displays completions for the current class, `Shift+Tab` shows documentation.

If you installed Python via the Anaconda package, you already have jupyter notebooks. Otherwise, you should be able to install it using `pip`, by running the command `pip3 install jupyter`.

To start using the jupyter notebook, open a command line in the root directory of your git project, and run `jupyter notebook`.
This should automatically open a new tab in your browser.

### Tasks:


* create a new jupyter notebook
  * import the cat library, and
  * create separate cells with documentation for each step of the process (download, splitting, etc)

* work through the [pandas exercises](pandas_101.ipynb)
